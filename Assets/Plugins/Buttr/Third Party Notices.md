# Third Party Notices

This package includes both general-purpose C# code and Unity-specific code.

While some files in this package reference Unity namespaces (e.g., UnityEngine, UnityEditor),
no Unity binaries or third-party libraries are included.

All code is original and authored by Crumpet Labs.

No external dependencies, open-source libraries, or third-party assets are used.
